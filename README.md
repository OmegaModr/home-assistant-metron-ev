# Metron EV charger component for Home Assistant

Custom component to support Metron EV chargers.

A few useful sensors are exported along with services to set charging current, time delay and toggle solar charging

This is a fork of https://github.com/OmegaModr/home-assistant-metron-ev

## Installation

There are 2 different methods of installing the custom component

### HACS installation

1. Add this repository from HACS->Integrations->Custom repositories.
2. Enter https://github.com/LeoAlioth/home-assistant-metron-evse and select integration as the type
3. Install the latest version
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Install the component from Settings->Integrations. You may have to clear the browser cache to make the Metron integration appear in the list.

### Git installation

1. Make sure you have git installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to you home assistant configuration folder.
3. Create a `custom_components` folder of it does not exist, navigate down into it after creation.
4. Execute the following command: `git clone https://github.com/LeoAlioth/home-assistant-metron-evse.git ev_metron_websockets`

## Frontend cards

To use the services and sensors on lovelace dashboards use the Charger-card at https://github.com/tmjo/charger-card

As a basic starting point use the configuration below to get you started.
Change the entity names to your specific ones.

```yaml
type: custom:charger-card
brand: template
show_leds: true

    entity_id: sensor.doma_station_name

## Configuration

Configuration is done through in Configuration > Integrations where you first configure the name and ip address of the station.

## Use
The basic use of the integrations from the UI should be self-explanatory. The integration defines a number of services that can be used from automations and scripts to control the charger and the charging process. The available services can be found in Home Assistant at Developer tools->Services.

The easiest way to set up services and their parameters is to use the automation editor or the developer tools. However, you can also write the code in plain yaml. The UI will use device_id as target for the services. This is a random string generated internally by HA and is not very user friendly. 

Three examples of the services you can call:
```yaml
service: ev_metron_websockets.toggle_solar
data:
  device_id: c06269a64fc9f8f8dc150142f3bde4ce
```
```yaml
service: ev_metron_websockets.set_dynamic_limit
data:
  current: 12
  device_id: c06269a64fc9f8f8dc150142f3bde4ce
```
```yaml
service: ev_metron_websockets.set_charger_delay
data:
  time: 60
  device_id: c06269a64fc9f8f8dc150142f3bde4ce
```
