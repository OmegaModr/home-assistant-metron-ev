# Metron EV Websockets integration

This integration exposes your Teams client's local websockets API data as Home Assistant sensors.

All sensors offered by the API are available.

Buttons are also offered to provide access to actions which are available using the API.

## Installation

Either:

A) Add the custom repository in HACS, install it, then use the usual add integration functionality.

B) Copy the ``custom_components/ev_metron_websockets`` into your HA ``custom_components`` folder.
